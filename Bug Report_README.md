Title: Duplicate Section in Registered Sections

Description: When a student tries to register for courses on the AIUB portal, duplicate sections of the same course are displayed as options for registration. This creates confusion for the students as they may accidentally register for the same section twice, leading to scheduling conflicts and other issues.
